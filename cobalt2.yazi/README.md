# 🎨 Cobalt2 for Yazi

✨ **A faithful port of Wes Bos' iconic Cobalt2 color scheme** for the **Yazi file manager**.

This theme brings the **vibrant, high-contrast Cobalt2 colors** to:

* 🗂 **Yazi’s interface** – file manager panes, tabs, status bars, headers, and footers
* 💻 **Code preview** – syntax highlighting for comments, keywords, strings, functions, variables, numbers, and more

With this theme, **file navigation and code viewing** become visually consistent, striking, and easy on the eyes.

> Perfect for users who love **dark-themed, high-contrast environments** and want a modern, colorful terminal experience.
